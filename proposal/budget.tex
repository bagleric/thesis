\section{Budget}

% If you are applying for research funding, you will probably also have to include a detailed budget that shows how much each part of the project will cost.

% Make sure to check what type of costs the funding body will agree to cover, and only include relevant items in your budget. For each item, include:

% Cost: exactly how much money do you need?
% Justification: why is this cost necessary to complete the research?
% Source: how did you calculate the amount?
% To determine your budget, think about:

% Travel costs: do you need to go to specific locations to collect data? How will you get there, how long will you spend there, and what will you do there (e.g. interviews, archival research)?
% Materials: do you need access to any tools or technologies? Are there training or installation costs?
% Assistance: do you need to hire research assistants for the project? What will they do and how much will you pay them? Will you outsource any other tasks such as transcription?
% Time: do you need to take leave from regular duties such as teaching? How much will you need to cover the time spent on the research?
